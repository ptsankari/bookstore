<p class="highlight">Sometimes we feel sad about the things in past or about the things that surround us. It's complety ok to feel about it but,that shouldn't be forever. Sometimes we have to let things go. Past is in the past and it is your choice to forget about it or cry over is again and again.Remember,everything is within you. You can move on and find happiness if you want or brag about the awful things again and again. Always stay postivie sweetie.</p>

<p class="highlight">We often care about others people's opinion too much. It's ok, it's good to get help from others but when you keep thinking about others and their life,you'll tend to care more about them than your life and your work. Stop it, focus more on you. This is your life and you are the only one who can better it up or make it even more terrible.</p>
